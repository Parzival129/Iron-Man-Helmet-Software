# Iron-Man-Helmet-Software
This is code that is used for the onboard raspberry pi in the helmet. It has text to speech and speech to text features. It also makes use of a small transparent OLED display that can be used to display useful information directly to the wearer. Currentely development is focused on software, but soon we will move onto some prototyping for the first version of a completely portable helmet.
